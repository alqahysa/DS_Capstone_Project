incompatible upgrade of an existing dataset instance that is shared with other apps or pipelines. as a hydrator user, i want to explore the datasets created by my pipeline. as a hydrator user, i want

version of it type. as a developer, i want to take a dataset offline, so that i can perform a long-running maintenance or migration procedure. as a dataset developer, i want to implement custom

that application creation fails if any of its datasets cannot be created. as an app developer, i want to ensure that application redeployment fails if any of its datasets cannot be reconfigured. as an app developer, i want to tolerate existing datasets if their properties are different but compatible when creating a dataset as part of app deployment. as a pipeline designer, i want to get a

the pipeline requires. as a user, i want to specify as part of dataset configuration whether it is explorable. as a user, i want to specify the explore schema separately. as a user, i want to ensure that dataset creation fails if the dataset cannot be enabled for explore. as a user, i want to ensure that dataset reconfiguration fails if the corresponding update of the explore table fails. as a

the system can be kept low. as an univitservice, i want to store archived data directly on the hcp object store, so that features can be made. as an univitservice, i want to be able to export all data to a different system, so that i am not tied into one system which may not be the most appropriate at some point in the future. as a developer, i want to deposit and maintain datasets via an api such as sword, so that my service can interact with the archive. as an academicpublisher, i want to make persistent web links between my articles and underlying datasets, so that my journals can be seen to be filled with robust, high quality research. as a fundingbody, i want to be reassured that researchers i fund have robust archival plans for their data, so that i can be sure that funding them is a worthwhile investment. as a fundingbody, i want to harvest metadata on outputs from research i fund, so that i can analyse effectiveness of funding strategy and i can encourage cross fertilisation of
