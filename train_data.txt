researcher, i want to have the ability to store all the inputs for an experiment so that the provenance of the results can be verified. as a researcher, i want to have the ability to search for files by file type and format. as a researcher, i want to have the ability to bulk upload directories and files with minimal effort. as a researcher, i want to associate meta data to the group as a whole at some point in time after the bulk upload has completed, so that i have a period of time to reflect on suitable values for the meta data. as a user, i want to have the ability to change the sharing and ownership of multiple files. as a researcher, i want to have the ability to restrict the data i share to certain researchers or groups of researchers. as a researcher, i want to have the ability to locate and access data that colleagues want to share. as a researcher, i want to have the ability to interact with a revision control system so that i can keep track of changes to files over time. as a juniorresearcher, i want to have the ability to harvest knowledge from within the group, so that i can learn from more experienced researchers. as a researcher, i want to secure remote access to the neurohub node when working away from the laboratory as a researcher, i want to have a group-level repository for sharing papers/reviews/comments with other researchers. as a researcher, i want to have

move on to the next item when we agree. as a moderator, i want to have the "estimate" field filled in automatically if all estimators show the same card, so that i can accept it more quickly. as a moderator, i want to enter the agreed-upon estimate, so that we can move on to the next item when we agree. as a moderator, i want to estimate a story we estimated earlier in the session again, so

archive. as an academicpublisher, i want to make persistent web links between my articles and underlying datasets, so that my journals can be seen to be filled with robust, high quality research. as a fundingbody, i want to be reassured that researchers i fund have robust archival plans for their data, so that i can be sure that funding them is a worthwhile investment. as a fundingbody, i want to
