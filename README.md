## Introduction

In software engineering, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. A user story describes three componants:
- Who wants the functionality
- What functionality the end users or stakeholders want
the system to provide
- Why the end users and stakeholders need this functionality (optional).

In this project we aim at extracting a conceptual model that can staderized the understanding of the requiermens among stakeholders, product owner and development team. The extraction process can be applied with help of the NLP techniques since the input of is a requierments that written in English.To achive this goal, we went through several stages as below:
- Data Collection
- Data Munging
- Annotating Data
- Train NER Model


## Dataset Description
A collection of 22 dataset of more than 50 requierments each a.k.a 'user story'. These were all found online, or retrieved from software companies with a permission to disclose.
